# Poor and Rich Optimization Algorithm

Implementation and benchmark of [new human-based and multi populations algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197619302167) by Seyyed Hamid Samareh Moosavi and Vahid Khatibi Bardsiri.
Made for Seminar 1 university course.

## Implementation

Poor and rich algorithm along with genetic algorithm (for comparison) using:
- Rust

## Benchmark

Both algorithms tested using [COCO](http://numbbo.github.io/coco/) with Rust bindings (coco-rs).
